Belit
=====

Belit - is a transliteration of the Belarusian language into the Latin alphabet that requires only characters from an English keyboard and resembles English spelling as closely as possible. Its main intention is to make it easier for foreigners to read and write in Belarusian, especially if they require a Cyrillic layout for their keyboard.

Rules
-----

* The letter **y** always sounds like it does in the word **y**es
* The **\*** character makes the consonants before it sound soft (hard to explain to an English-speaking person — you have to hear how it sounds).
* Letters **e** and **i** always make consonants before them sound soft (imagine they always have **\*** before them).
* Except if there is a **'** character which makes the consonant before it sound normal.
* Some sounds consist of two letters: **ch** (like in **ch**air), **sh** (like in **sh**orts), **zh** (like in deci**si**on). If you see a **'** between these two letters (e.g. **c'h**, **s'h**,**z'h**) — that means they are pronounced separately and sound as they usually do.
