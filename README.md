Belit
=====

Belit - is a transliteration for Belarusian language into latin alphabet that requires only characters from English keyboard and resembles English spelling as closely as possible. It's may intention is to make it easier for foreigners from all over the world to read and write in Belarusian, especially if they don't have cyrilic letters on their keyboard

Rules
-----

*   **y** letter always sounds like it does in the word **y**es
*   **\*** character makes the consonant before it sound soft (hard to explain to an english speaking person - you just have to hear how it sounds)
*   Letters **e** and **i** always make consonants before them sound soft (imagine they always have **\*** before them)
*   Except if there is a **'** character which makes the consonant before it sound normal
*   There are sounds that consist of two letters: **ch** (like in **ch**air), **sh** (like in **sh**orts), **zh** (like in deci**si**on). If you see a **'** between these two letters (e.g. **c'h**, **s'h**,**z'h**) - that just means they are pronounced separately and sound as they normally do
